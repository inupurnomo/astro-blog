This is an example blog post with React components. This page is using the `Image` component from Next.js.

  height={960}
  priority
/>
```

### Code Blocks

This starter also comes with fancy code blocks with code titles.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
